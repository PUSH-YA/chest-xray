Chest X-rays are a primary diagnostic tool for identifying thoracic diseases.

We are developing an efficient X-ray representation for automating and benchmarking weakly supervised classification and localization of common thoracic diseases, while overcoming challenges of a large data scale (~ 112k xrays), annotation constraints, and weak supervision.
