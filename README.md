## UBC Medicine Datathon 2025 (Team 8)

### Team Members:

#### My Main contributions to the team:
  - **Pinecone ETL**: ETL data pipeline to process **100+** Gb of Lung X-ray images for efficient "similar" vector retrieval
  - **EfficientNet-v5**: ResNet-50 inspired architecture for feature extraction ($112Gb \to 2.7 Gb$)
  - **PCA/AutoEncoder:** Dimension reduction using PCA ($95\\%$ variance explained) and AutoEncoder (absolute $0.6$ Average Reconstruction loss) ($2.7 Gb \to 0.3 Gb$)

## Workflow

Chest X-rays, a primary diagnostic tool for identifying thoracic diseases, are the focus of our project, which aims to develop an efficient X-ray representation for automating and benchmarking supervised classification and localization of common thoracic diseases. By leveraging clinical metadata, bounding box annotations, and efficient vector retrieval via Pinecone, we address challenges posed by large-scale datasets (~112k X-rays), annotation constraints, and weak supervision, and build robust classification models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers.

## Overall metrics for positive classes:
- Overall positive recall: 0.1135
- Overall positive precision: 0.3384
- Overall positive F1 score: 0.1700
- Mean AUC ROC: 0.7242
- Mean Average Precision: 0.1253

## Implications:
1. **Disclaimer:** AIs are note doctors
2. Using algorithms to assist preliminary decisions
3. However, there needs to be studies on the complex of human-robot interaction.
4. Like any other model, the model is vulnerable to concept drift.
